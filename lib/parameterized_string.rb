# This class represents parameterized strings, such as those used in printf. The
# idea is that the string has certain parameter specifiers (described by a
# regex), where each parameter identifies a unique value that can be substituted
# in its place. Both foreign and English messages in PO files are parameterized strings,
# and currently there are four possible kinds of parameter specifiers:
#   (1) {\d+}
#   (2) %{<identifier>}
#   (3) {{<identifier>}}
#   (4) printf placeholder
# where <identifier> is a variable name, such as those found in Java, C, C++,
# etc. As an example, let msg = "There are {0} people that have {1} hair." Here,
# the param. specifiers are of the form described in (1). We can substitute
# "5" for {0}, and "brown" for {1} to get the message:
#   "There are 5 people that have brown hair."
# Each param. specifier is uniquely identified as follows (case by case):
#   (1) For these specifiers, the argument # (e.g. 0, 1, 2) uniquely identifies
#   the specifier
#
#   (2) and (3) These are uniquely classified by their identifier.
#
#   (4) There are two possibilities here:
#         (a) If the parameterized string has positional arguments, e.g. a string such
#         as:
#            "This is an example of %1$s message with %2$s and %1$d positional
#            parameters for %3$f."
#         Then each parameter is uniquely identified by the number before
#         the "$". So our parameters would be ["1", "2", "1", "3"] in order of appearance.
#
#         (b) If the parameterized string does not have positional arguments (standard
#         printf string), then each parameter is identified by their position (indexed by 1).
#         For example,
#             "This is a standard %d printf string %s that is used as an
#             example %f."
#         So here, %d = 1, %s = 2, %f = 3 so we'd have [1, 2, 3].

  # The constructor takes in two parameters:
  #   (1) param_str - The param string
  #   (2) param_re  - The regex describing the param specifiers. Must be
  #   one of the regexes in the FORMAT_RE array.
  #
  # We can describe all param strings by the following regex:
  #   <prefix>(<param><mid>)*
  # where <prefix> is the initial part of the string that does
  # not contain any param specifiers; <param> is a param specifier
  # described by the param_re; and <mid> is the part of the string
  # after <param> that does not contain any param specifiers.
  #
  # Thus, we deconstruct the param_str parameter into two pieces:
  #   (1) prefix
  #   (2) param_mids
  # where (2) is an array of pairs (param, mid). Note that we specify
  # a <param> by its unique identifier, as described above.
  #
  # For performance reasons (to avoid a lot of garbage collection), we
  # also keep track of additional components:
  #   (3) params - These are all the param specifiers in the param_str, in
  #   order of appearance (there can be duplicates!)
  #
  #   (4) length - The raw length of param_str, where param specifiers
  #   are not included.
  #
  #   (5) has_adjacent_params - This is a boolean indicating whether or not
  #   the paramted string has adjacent param specifiers. Important for
  #   regex matching (see 6), because these param strings can result in
  #   catastrophic backtracking. Note that a param string has adjacent
  #   param specifiers iff there exists a "mid" that is the empty string.
  #
  #   (6) param_str_re - A regex used to match a paramted string that arose
  #   out of the "param_str" passed into this class. For example, if we
  #   have param_str = "This %s is worth %d dollars" and we get a message:
  #      "I went to Denny's today. This pancake is worth 10 dollars"
  #   then match_re would indicate that the phrase "This pancake is worth 10
  #   dollars" matches our param_str, where the %s param specifier is the
  #   term "pancake" and %d the term "dollars". The matching regex is
  #   constructed by replacing each param specifier with (.*) in the overall
  #   param_str.
