# This class represents the reverse-lookup table for an array of PO files.

# from services implemented in a specific language (e.g. Clojure). Or they

  # The translation algorithm. Here's how it works. Initially, the
  # message is untranslated, so max_untranslated_length = message.length.
  # We loop and do the following:
  #   (1) If the message was translated from a previous iteration, then we
  #   can reduce the search space by doing a binary search starting at our
  #   previous index, ix, to find the next location that we should start
  #   translating from. This lets us skip entries that we don't need to
  #   consider.
  #
  #   (2) If there is no location, i.e. the remaining po entries are too
  #   large for our message to be translated, OR we've reached the end of
  #   our @entries array, we exit.
  #
  #   (3) Otherwise, we translate the message with the current entry. If
  #   that translation resulted in the entire message being translated OR
  #   we have reached our maximum depth, we exit. Otherwise, we loop to our
  #   next entry and repeat (1) - (3).
  #
  # Initially, was_translated is vacuously true. One key invariant in the
  # loop is that the ix returned by bsearch_index_left(ix) is >= the passed-in
  # ix (because log_message's max_untranslated_length will shrink). So our
  # loop is guaranteed to terminate.
  # 
  # NOTE: For foreign log messages containing parameters that are not foreign
  # strings, this algorithm will loop all the way to the end of the table because
  # the current code has no way of determining if a parameter is a foreign message
  # or not (it assumes that every parameter is equally likely to be a foreign string).
