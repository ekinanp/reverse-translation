module LogParser
  # This method takes in regexp components that make up a prefix,
  # and builds the overall prefix expression out of them by including 
  # whitespace in-between them. For example if we do build_prefix_re(r1, r2),
  # then this will return r3 = r1\s+r2.
  #
  # Each component should be either a single element array (indicating that it's optional),
  # or not.
